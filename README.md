# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction â€“ Kaggle Competition

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model capable of accurately estimating car prices based on detailed listings scraped from a popular classified ads website. The dataset includes extensive vehicle information such as brand, model, production year, mileage, fuel type, and equipment features.

ðŸ“‚ The dataset consists of the following files:

- `sales_ads_train.csv` â€“ Original training data with vehicle prices.
- `synthetic_training_data_sdv_pl.csv` â€“ Synthetic data generated using the SDV framework.
- `synthetic_training_data_mostlyai_pl.csv` â€“ Synthetic data generated using the MostlyAI platform.
- `sales_ads_test.csv` â€“ Test data without prices, used for model evaluation.
